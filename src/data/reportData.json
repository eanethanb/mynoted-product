X-axis = \"Network Architecture & Implementation\" (0-10) and Y-axis = \"Cloud Engineering & System Integration\" (0-10).\nDraw a vertical dashed line at X = 5 and a horizontal dashed line at Y = 5 to create four quadrants:\n  • Upper-Right (X≥5, Y≥5): Strong on both dimensions — well-rounded.\n  • Upper-Left  (X<5, Y≥5): Strong Y-axis breadth, weaker X-axis depth.\n  • Lower-Right (X≥5, Y<5): Strong X-axis depth, lighter Y-axis execution.\n  • Lower-Left  (X<5, Y<5): Developing on both — largest growth opportunity.\n\nPlotted points:\n  ★ Rahul Jadhav (System and Network Engineer, Microsoft) → (0.0, 3.3) [Lower-Left]\n  ● Ha Duc Binh (Presales Consulting, Network Manager, Hewlett ..., Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)) → (4.4, 2.2) [Lower-Left]\n  ● Prince Sarkodie (System Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon Web Services (AWS)) → (0.0, 0.0) [Lower-Left]\n  ● Zhichun Roy Jiang (Network Architect at Alibaba Cloud - 领英, Alibaba Cloud) → (4.4, 0.0) [Lower-Left]\n\nTarget positioning rationale: Limited X-axis depth — development opportunity. Y-axis execution lighter — room to grow."}
